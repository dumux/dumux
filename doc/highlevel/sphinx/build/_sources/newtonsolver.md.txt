## newtonSolver

|The newtonSolver class is used to execute the newton algorithm described in {ref}`Newton Loop`. The assembly of the linear system is instanciated. Furthermore, a linear solver is used to solve the linear system of equations. In the newtonSolver class the evaluation of the solution is done.|

### Key functionalities

1. solve()
   1. Call of the assembleJacobianAndResidual() function of the {ref}`assembler`
   2. Call of the solve function of the {ref}`linearSolver`
   3. Update the solution using the newtonUpdate() function
   4. Evaluate if convergence is reached using the newtonConverged() function
