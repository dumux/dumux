\section{Input and Output}
\label{sec:inputandoutput}

This section summarizes some ideas about grid generation and grid formats that can be used by \Dumux
for input and output formats.
In general,
\Dumux can read grids from files and construct grids inside the code with a \texttt{GridCreator}.
All grids are constructed inside a so called \texttt{GridManger}.  
Note that some \texttt{GridCreator}s are already available in \Dumux, so e.g.
construction of a structured grid is fairly easy. We will subsequently introduce the supported file formats,
the standard \texttt{GridCreator} and its capabilities
and briefly mention how to customize and deal with common other grid formats.

\subsection{Supported grid file formats}
\Dumux can read grids from file using the Dune Grid Format (DGF) or the Gmsh mesh format.

\subsubsection{Dune Grid Format}
Most of our \Dumux tests and tutorials use the Dune Grid Format (DGF) to read in grids. A detailed description
of the DGF format and some examples can be found in the \Dune doxygen documentation
\textbf{(Modules $\rightarrow$ I/O $\rightarrow$ Dune Grid Format (DGF)}). To generate larger or more
complex DGF files, we recommend to write your own scripts, e.g in \Cplusplus, Matlab or Python.

The DGF format can also used to read in spatial parameters defined on the grid. These parameters can
be defined on nodes as well as on the elements. An example for predefined parameters on a grid
can be found in the  \texttt{dumux/test/porousmediumflow/co2/implicit/} folder.

\subsubsection{Gmsh Mesh Format}
Gmsh is an open-source flexible grid generator for unstructured finite-element meshes (\cite{GEUZAINE2009}, \url{http://geuz.org/gmsh/}).
\Dumux supports the default Gmsh mesh format (MSH). For the format specifics and how to create grids with Gmsh, e.g. using
the provided GUI, we refer to the Gmsh documentation (\url{http://geuz.org/gmsh/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html}).

The MSH format can contain element and boundary markers defined in the grid. Thus, boundaries can be easily marked as e.g. inflow boundaries
using Gmsh. Further, the format supports higher order elements. They can be used to create boundary parameterization supported by e.g. the grid
manager \texttt{UGGrid}.
An example can be found in \texttt{dumux/test\allowbreak/io/gridcreator}.

\subsubsection{Other Grid Formats}
Grid formats other than .DGF and .MSH grids will have to be converted to the .DGF or .MSH format before they can be used in \Dumux.
If conversion is not an option, another possibility would be to write your own \texttt{GridCreator}. Examples of other grid formats,
which have previously been either converted or custom-created in \Dumux, are Petrel grids (cornerpoint grids),
ArtMesh grids (fractured network grids), and ICEM grids (CAD developed grids).

\subsection{The default \texttt{GridCreator}}
The default \texttt{GridCreator} is called \texttt{GridCreator} and is automatically avaible in all problems.
It can construct grids from a DGF file (*.dgf) by simply providing the filename to the grid in the \texttt{Grid} group~\footnote{Note
that group name \texttt{Grid} is the default group name and can be customized in your problem changing the string property \texttt{GridParameterGroup}.
This way it is possible, e.g. for problems with more than one grid, to set different group names for each grid, thus configuring them separately.}
of the input file:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxParameterFile]
[Grid]
File = mydgfgrid.dgf
\end{lstlisting}
If you are using an unstructured grid manager like \texttt{UGGrid} or \texttt{ALUGrid}, constructing a grid from a Gmsh mesh file (*.msh) is just changing a line:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxParameterFile]
[Grid]
File = mygmshgrid.msh
\end{lstlisting}
\Dumux will tell you in case your selected grid manager does not support reading Gmsh files. You want to intially refine your grid? It's just adding a line:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxParameterFile]
[Grid]
File = mydgfgrid.dgf
Refinement = 4
\end{lstlisting}
When reading a Gmsh file, further parameters are recognized. \texttt{Verbose} enables verbose output on grid construction when set to $1$.
\texttt{BoundarySegments} enables reading parametrized boundaries. \texttt{PhysicalEntities} enables reading boundary and element flags.

\subsubsection{Grid manager specific parameters}
The default \texttt{GridCreator} supports also a selection of grid specific parameters.
To give an example we look at the commonly used unstructured grid manager \texttt{UGGrid}.
\texttt{UGGrid}s support red-green refinement per default. One can turn off the green closure by setting the grid's closure type
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxParameterFile]
[Grid]
File = mydgfgrid.dgf
ClosureType = None # or Green
\end{lstlisting}
For all available parameters see the Doxygen documentation.

\subsubsection{Structured grids}
If you want to construct a structured grid with the default grid creator instead of the \texttt{File} key supply
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxParameterFile]
[Grid]
LowerLeft = 0 0 0
UpperRight = 1 1 1
Cells = 10 10 20
\end{lstlisting}
where \texttt{LowerLeft} is a vector to the lower left corner of the grid and \texttt{UpperRight} a vector to the upper right corner.
\texttt{Cells} is a vector with the number of cells in each coordinate direction. Note that for a grid in a two-dimensional world, the
vectors only have two entries.

Depending on the grid manager further parameters are recognized.
\texttt{UGGrid}s, for example, supports simplex elements as well as hexahedral elements
(called simplified ``cube'' in \Dune). When creating a structured grid, we can select the cell type as follows
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxParameterFile]
[Grid]
LowerLeft = 0 0 0
UpperRight = 1 1 1
Cells = 10 10 20
CellType = Cube # or Simplex
\end{lstlisting}
For all available parameters see the Doxygen documentation.

\subsection{Output formats}
The default output format for \Dumux is the VTK file format. Additionally it is possible 
to generate plots with gnuplot directly from \Dumux.

\subsubsection{VTK file format}
Dumux allows to write out simulation results via the \texttt{vtkWirter}.
For every print out step, a single *.vtu file is created. For parallel simulations one file
per print out step is generated for each processor. 
The *.pvd file groups the single *.vtu files and contains additionally the time step information.
Also it is the main file for the visualisation with ParaView.
The VTK file format is also supported by other common visualisation programs like Visit and Tecplot. 

\subsubsection{Customize the VTK output}
Using the respective \texttt{initOutputModule} function of the model \texttt{IOFields} a default
set of variables is stored in the VTK files. But it's also possible to add further variables.
For that you can use the method \texttt{addField} of the \texttt{vtkWriter}. E.g. add a variable called temperatureExact:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxCode]
vtkWriter.addField(problem->getExactTemperature(), "temperatureExact");
\end{lstlisting}

The first input argument of this method is the value of the additional variable, provided by a method of the corresponding problem.
If it doesn't already exists, the user has to provide this method.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxCode]
//! get the analytical temperature
const std::vector<Scalar>& getExactTemperature()
{
    return temperatureExact_;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The second input argument is the name of the additional variable (as it should be written in the VTK files).
The example above is taken from:\\ \texttt{test/porousmediumflow/1pnc/implicit/test\_1p2cni\_convection\_fv.cc}

\subsubsection{Gnuplot interface}
\Dumux provides a gnuplot interface, which can be used to plot results and generate 
image files (e.g. png). To use the gnuplot interface gnuplot has to be installed. For more information see \ref{gnuplot}.
