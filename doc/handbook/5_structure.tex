\section{Directory Structure}
\label{sc_structure}

\Dumux has the following folder structure, which is similar to other \Dune modules.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{bin}: binaries, e.g. used for the automatic testing, post-processing, installation
\item \texttt{cmake}: the configuration options for building \Dumux
\item \texttt{doc}: files necessary for the Doxygen documentation and this handbook, and various logos
\item \texttt{dumux}: the main folder, containing the source files. See Fig. \ref{fig:dumux-structure}
      for a visualized structure. For more information on the models, have a look at the
      Doxygen documentation.
\item \texttt{examples}: well-documented examples of applying \Dumux to typical physical problems. In the \texttt{README.md} files, the setup is explained, the used code is presented as well as documented and images resulting from the simulation are included. The \texttt{README.md} files are located directly in the subfolders of \texttt{examples} and can be displayed by web browsers.
\item \texttt{test}: tests for each numerical model and some functionality.
      The structure is equivalent to the \texttt{dumux} folder, the \texttt{references} folder
      contains solutions for the automatic testing. Each test program consist of a main file
      \texttt{main.cc}, the problem definition \texttt{*problem.hh} (specifying initial and boundary
      conditions), and an input file \texttt{params.input}.
      If necessary, spatially dependent parameters are defined in \texttt{*spatialparameters.hh}.
      For more detailed descriptions of the tests, please have a look at the Doxygen documentation.
\end{itemize}
