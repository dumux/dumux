@defgroup CCTpfaDiscretization Two-point flux approximation (Tpfa)
@brief A cell-centered finite volume scheme with two-point flux approximation.
@ingroup CCDiscretization

@brief A cell-centered finite volume scheme with multi-point flux approximation.
@ingroup CCDiscretization

@defgroup CVFEDiscretization Control-volume Finite Element Methods
@brief Control-volume finite element schemes (e.g. box method)
Control-volume finite element schemes are based on finite element basis functions for interpolation but define control volumes to construct a finite volume scheme. They can be interpreted both as finite volume or as (Petrov-Galerkin) finite element scheme.

@ingroup CVFEDiscretization

@defgroup FaceCenteredStaggeredDiscretization Staggered Grid Finite Volume Method
@brief Discretization for the momentum balance of the Navier-Stokes equations. Can be used to build a marker-and-cell scheme (MAC) together with Tpfa for the discretization of the mass balance equation.
@ingroup Discretization

@defgroup StaggeredDiscretization Staggered FV scheme
@brief A staggered finite volume scheme with degrees of freedom at cell-centers and facets. In this implementation, momentum control volumes do not explicitly exist, but the implementation uses workarounds.
@note This is an outdated implementation of the MAC scheme and will be replaced. See @ref FaceCenteredStaggeredDiscretization
