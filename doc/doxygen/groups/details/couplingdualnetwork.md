@addtogroup DualNetworkCoupling

The dual network model is an abstract representation of a porous medium which exceeds at modelling heat transfer.

![Nodes and links that make up a dual network.](multidomainDualNetworkCoupling.svg){html: width=45%}

The nodes denote pores (red) and grains (yellow). Each node is associated with a volume measure as well as links which represent pore throats, solid contact surfaces and void-solid interfaces. A detailed description of this approach can be found in \cite Koch2021b.
