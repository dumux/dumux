@defgroup Material Constitutive models
@brief Constitutive relations for fluids, solids, fluid-matrix interactions, and more
@details Constitutive relations formalize the functional dependence among physical variables, thereby providing the missing equations to close systems. Some constitutive relations, in particular if they are ad-hoc (e.g. Hooke's law) or empirical
and not derived from basic principles, are also called material laws.
Implementations of the functional relationships available in DuMu<sup>x</sup> are collected in the folder `dumux/material`.

Most implementations follow one of the following paradigms

* free functions (in nested namespaces),
* stateless classes with static member functions where all parameters are function arguments,
* statefull classes that contain parameters that need to be initialized.

Stateless, purely static classes have the advantage that only the class type needs to be known to
the class using them. Statefull classes need to be instantiated
and the instantiated object is passed to the consumer class.
