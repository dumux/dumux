@brief Grids available in DuMu<sup>X</sup>

The DUNE core module dune-grid provides Dune::YaspGrid, Dune::OneDGrid, and the meta-grid manager Dune::GeometryGrid. Further grid implementations are available as additional modules.
To use these grids in DuMu<sup>X</sup> you need to include the corresponding grid manager. The structure of the interface and the necessary keys in the input file can be found in the class documentation. Sometimes more than one interface for a grid exists.
