@defgroup StokesDarcyCoupling Stokes-Darcy domain coupling
@brief Couples domains with equal-dimension multi-physics problems in a Stokes-Darcy coupling.
@ingroup BoundaryCoupling

@defgroup DualNetworkCoupling Coupling for dual network approach for pore network models
@brief Coupling for dual network approach for pore network models
@ingroup MultiDomain

@defgroup EmbeddedCoupling Embedded mixed-dimension coupling mode
@brief Couples problems of different dimensions where one or more lower-dimensional problems (lowdim) are embedded in a higher-dimensional domain (bulk).
@ingroup MultiDomain

@defgroup FacetCoupling Conforming mixed-dimension facet coupling mode
@brief Couples problems of different dimensions where one or more lower-dimensional problems (lowdim) live on the facets of the higher-dimensional domain (bulk). Examples are discrete facet conforming fracture models and problems with physics on a domain surface.
