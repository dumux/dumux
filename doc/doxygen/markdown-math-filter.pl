# Doxygen filter to format markdown math for Doxygen
#
# In Doxygen documentation, including markdown files or Jupyter notebooks that
# get converted to markdown, you can use standard $...$ syntax for inline math,
# and $$...$$ or ```math...``` syntax for display-style math.
#
# This is needed until Doxygen adds support for markdown-style math, see
# https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/8009.

# This is added to the original to allow for $$...$$ for display math
# Wrap inline math in \f$...\f$
# - Match code blocks (wrapped in ``` or \code...\endcode) and inline code
#   (wrapped in ` or ``), and print them directly to the output with no changes.
# - Match display math blocks (wrapped in \f[...\f], \f{...\f}, or
#   \begin...\end), and print them directly to the output with no changes.
# - Replace $$...$$ by \f{equation}{...\f}.
# - The '?' makes the pattern match lazily, i.e., match as few characters as
#   possible.
# - Modifiers:
#     s: Allow '.' to match newlines
#     g: Replace all occurrences
#     e: Evaluate replacement as perl code, so we can switch between
#        replacements depending on the matched alternative, using the '//'
#        (definedness) operator.
#     x: Ignore spaces for better readability
