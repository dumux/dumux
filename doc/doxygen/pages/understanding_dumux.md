| <div class="dumux-circled-text">∂</div> | @ref Models               | An overview of the mathematical models available in DuMux. These models can also be used as building blocks of coupled multidomain models. In the DuMux course, you learn how to implement a new model from scratch in the [Exercise Model (DuMuX course)](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux-course/-/blob/master/exercises/exercise-model/README.md?ref_type=heads). |
| <div class="dumux-circled-text">🔡</div>   | @ref basic-concepts                  | The basic components of a DuMux simulation explained. This will help you to understand what basic concepts are behind the types and classes used in a typical simulation setup. |
| <div class="dumux-circled-text">⚒️</div> | @ref runtime-parameters              | How to set, add, and modify runtime parameters in DuMux. This will enable you to configure your simulation at runtime. |
| <div class="dumux-circled-text">⚙️</div> | @ref running-in-parallel              | How to run DuMux in parallel. This will help you to speed up your simulations using distributed and shared memory parallelism. |
| <div class="dumux-circled-text">🔁</div> | @ref input-and-output-formats       | How to read and write computational grids and other user data in different formats. |
| <div class="dumux-circled-text">🧩</div> | @ref MultiDomain | Introduction to the Multidomain framework of DuMux that allows coupling different models in various ways. |
| <div class="dumux-circled-text">📂</div> | @ref directory-structure              | An overview of the top-level and `dumux` directory structure of the DuMux source code. This will help you to navigate the codebase and find the files you need. |
| <div class="dumux-circled-text">💡</div> | @ref cheatsheet                       | A quick reference to some commonly used code patterns and control commands when simulating with DuMux. |
