| ![darcadarcy](coupling_boundary_general.svg) | Two porous media are coupled at touching boundaries. This scheme is already implemented for coupling two single-phase Darcy models [1p_1p](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/darcydarcy/1p_1p?ref_type=heads) as well as coupling a single-phase Darcy model to a two-phase Darcy model [1p_2p](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/darcydarcy/1p_2p?ref_type=heads). | @ref PorousmediumflowModels, @ref CCTpfaDiscretization,  @ref OnePModel, @ref TwoPModel, 2D-2D | - |
| ![ffpnm](coupling_boundary_ff_pnm.svg) | A free flow model and a pore network model are coupled. This scheme is already implemented for coupling a single-phase Navier-Stokes model and pore network model [1p_1p](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/freeflowporenetwork/1p_1p?ref_type=heads) and also for coupling two one-phase two-component models [1p2c_1p2c](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/freeflowporenetwork/1p_1p?ref_type=heads). These tests also cover non-isothermal models. | @ref NavierStokesModel, @ref PoreNetworkModels, @ref PoreNetworkDiscretization, @ref StaggeredDiscretization, @ref OnePModel, @ref OnePNCModel, @ref NIModel, 1D-2D | - |
| ![ffpm](coupling_boundary_general.svg) | A porous medium is coupled to a freeflow  domain. Concrete implementations are available for coupling a single-phase Navier-Stokes model to a single-phase Darcy model [1p_1p](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/freeflowporousmedium/1p_1p?ref_type=heads). Additionally, there are tests for coupling single-phase Stokes and Darcy models [1p_1p](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/stokesdarcy/1p_1p?ref_type=heads),  single-phase and two-phase models respectively [1p_2p](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/stokesdarcy/1p_2p?ref_type=heads). For varying numbers of phases and components, see [1p2c_1p2c](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/stokesdarcy/1p2c_1p2c?ref_type=heads), [1p2c_2p2c](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/stokesdarcy/1p2c_2p2c?ref_type=heads) and [1p3c_1p3c](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/test/multidomain/boundary/stokesdarcy/1p3c_1p3c?ref_type=heads). | @ref PorousmediumflowModels, @ref NavierStokesModel, @ref CCTpfaDiscretization, @ref StaggeredDiscretization, @ref OnePModel, @ref TwoPModel, @ref OnePNCModel, @ref TwoPTwoCModel, 2D-2D | - |
