# Benchmarks

DuMux has participated in multiple collaborative benchmark projects.
Moreover, the test suite contains a number of verifcation benchmarks
(such as convergence tests against analytical or manufactured solutions).
Below, we provide link to descriptions of these benchmarks and instructions
to reproduce the results.
