# Examples and tutorials

You have downloaded DuMux and its dependencies.
You have run `dunecontrol` and your first example compiled and showed a nice simulation in ParaView.
What now? *How on earth is this going to help me solve my multi-(phase, component, scale, physics) flow and transport problems in porous media systems?*
A great collection of additional resources can be found below.

__Details on the dumux lecture repository__

The `dumux-lecture` module can be
installed via the [`bin/installexternal.py` script](#install-external-dependencies-via-script).

The module is structured based on the different lectures:

* `mm`: Multiphase Modelling
* `efm`: Environmental Fluid Mechanics
* `mhs`: Modelling of Hydrosystems

The majority of applications are covered in the course "Multiphase Modelling" (`mm` folder),
while there are also some basic examples in the courses "Environmental Fluid Mechanics" (`efm` folder)
and "Modelling of Hydrosystems" (`mhs` folder).

These applications are primarily designed to enhance the understanding of conceptualizing the governing physical processes and their implementation in a numerical simulator. Different aspects of modeling multi-phase multi-component flow and transport processes are shown. The lectures focus on questions such as the assignment of boundary conditions, the choice of the appropriate physics for a given problem (which phases, which components), discretization issues, time stepping. You can find, for example, a comparison of different two-phase flow problems: The simpler approach considers two immiscible fluids while components in both phases with inter-phase mass transfer are considered in the more complex approach. All scenarios and their physical background are explained in additional LaTeX (`*.tex`) files, which are provided in sub-directories named description. The following test cases are contained in the `dumux-lecture` module:

* `buckleyleverett`: The Buckley-Leverett Problem is a classical porous media flow show case
* `co2plume`: Analysis of the influence of the gravitational number on a CO2 plume
* `columnxylene`: An experiment of the Research Facility for Subsurface Remediation, University of Stuttgart
* `convectivemixing`: A test case related to CO2 storage
* `fractures`: Two-phase flow in fractured porous media
* `fuelcell`: Water management in PEM fuel cells
* `heatpipe`: A show case for two-phase two-component flow with heat fluxes
* `heavyoil`: Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)
* `henryproblem`: A show case related to salt water intrusion
* `mcwhorter`: The McWhorter Problem is a classical porous media flow show case
* `naplinfiltration`: Infiltration of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) into soil
* `remediationscenarios`: Test case for NAPL contaminated unsaturated soils
* `groundwater`: Simple groundwater flow case for the course Modelling of Hydrosystems (mhs)
