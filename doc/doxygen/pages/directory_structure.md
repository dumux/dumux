# Directory Structure

## Top Level

DuMux has the following folder structure, which is similar to other DUNE modules.

* `bin`: executable scripts (Python/Bash) and helper tools, e.g. used for the automatic testing, post-processing, installation
* `cmake`: the configuration options and build system files
* @refdir{doc} "doc": files necessary for the Doxygen documentation and various logos
* @refdir{dumux} "dumux": the main folder, containing the source files. See below for more details.
* [`examples`](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/examples#open_file_folder-example-1-diffusion-equation): well-documented examples of applying DuMux to typical simulation scenarios of different complexity. The example documentation is best viewed with [a browser via GitLab](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/tree/master/examples#open_file_folder-example-1-diffusion-equation). In the `README.md` file of
each example, the setup is explained and the code is presented and described in detail.
* `test`: unit tests, integration tests and systems tests for each numerical model. The folder structure mimics the structure of the `dumux` folder (see below), the `references` folder contains solutions for the automatic testing. Each system (end user) test describes a full simulation. The setup usually consists of a main file (`main.cc`), the problem definition (`problem.hh`) specifying initial and boundary conditions, and a runtime parameter input file `params.input`. Often spatially-dependent parameters are defined in a separate header (`spatialparams.hh`).
