# Model

A `Model` class is a template class that serves as a basis for a concrete `Problem`. It serves as an interface for the `Problem` class and sets some restrictions to assure that a `Problem` class is correctly constructed, e.g. by constraining the number of fluid phases. It contains also checks, if a `Problem` class has all necessary subparts included to work.
