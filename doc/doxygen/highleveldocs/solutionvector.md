# SolutionVector

A `SolutionVector` class object is a container containing the primary variables for each degree of freedom (dof). It can be thought of as an arry of the form **sol\[i\]\[j\]**, where the index i iterates over the dofs and j iterates over the primary variables at dof i. Thus, sol[4][1] would return the second primary variable for the degree of freedom with the index 4. For example, for a porous medium test, the first primary variable could be the wetting-phase pressure and the second one could be the non-wetting phase saturation. Primary variables describe the quantities we solve for in our system of equations. Depending on the model, there can be arbitrarily many primary variables. The type of primary varaibles used is further specified in the `PrimaryVariables` class. The number of entries at every degree of freedom is defined in the `BasicModelTraits` trait class, see @model.
