     * \brief Currently, we do not consider cell-centered schemes for geomechanics.
     *        In case this is to be integrated, one would have to rethink the structure
     *        of e.g. the elastic volume variables and what quantities they store that
     *        are necessary for flux/stress evaluation. In the porous medium flow context we
     *        define permeabilities/thermal conductivities etc. in the volume variables
     *        and then do the harmonic average at scvf integration points during flux calculation.
     *        However, for the box scheme one could evaluate the parameters required for flux
     *        computations directly at the integration point without averaging. For compatibility
     *        reasons with cell-centered schemes, and because one can derive an expression for the
     *        harmonic average, we do not do so in the porous medium framework. For now, we choose
     *        a more FEM-like mentality in the geomechanics framework and call the parameters in the
     *        spatial parameters, required for stress calculations, for a position in the element
     *        when assembling the stress tensors. We do not store them in the volume variables! This
     *        means that in case cell-centered geomechanical models are considered in the future, both
     *        the volume variables as well as the stress tensor assembly laws have to be restructured!
