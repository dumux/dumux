Mandel's problem
--------------------

We solve Mandel's 2D consolidation problem with the poromechanics model.
The solver solves the fully coupled system with primary variables displacement and fluid pressure
using the P1-CVFE (Box) scheme for the displacement and CC-TPFA for the pressure. The governing equations
are given by
