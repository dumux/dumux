# Part 2: Main program flow

The main program flow is implemented in file `main.cc` described below.
For each spatial direction x, y and z, flow through the network is simulated using several pressure gradients and the resulting mass flow rates
are used to determine the upscaled properties.

The code documentation is structured as follows:
