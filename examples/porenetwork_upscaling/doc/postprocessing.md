# Part 4: Postprocessing/Visualization of a pore-network model

After compiling and running the code for a pore-network model, it is useful to visualize the results. Especially representing the pore bodies and throats by idealized geometries may help for interpreting the data (such as e.g. pressure distribution). Visulizing the pore-network and it's data can be done with the open source visualization application paraview. In the following we will show how to show the pore bodies and throats by spheres or boxes and tubes.

Before starting, make sure you loaded your results into paraview (`File` -> `Open` -> Select your .pvd or your *.vtp file).


## Change representation of pore bodies
### Representation as spheres

For showing the pore bodies as spheres, the `Glyph` filter can be used:
1. Select your input file (.pvd or .vtp) in the Pipeline Browser <br>
![](../img/doc_pnm_visualization_pipelineBrowser.png)
1. Choose the `Glyph` filter either by clicking on the respective icon (the name will appear if the cursor is moving over it) ![](../img/doc_pnm_visualization_glyphSymbol.png) <br>
or go to the `Filters` -> `Common` OR `Alphabetical` -> `Glyph`
1. Within the `Properties` panel, go to the `Glyph Source` section and choose the `Glyph Type` as `Spheres`. Once the `Spheres` are selected as the representation type, parameters for the sphere will appear. Increase the `Theta Resolution` and `Phi Resolution` to e.g. 15 (such that the sphere will be more smooth as it is approximated as polygons).
2. In the `Scale` section, you can modify how large the spheres should be displayed. 
   - For showing all spheres with the same size, choose for the `Scale Array` -> `No scale array`, then adapt the `Scale factor` by clicking on the icon ![](../img/doc_pnm_visualization_resetValue.png) for resetting the value using current data values. You can also give a concrete value, but make sure it is not too small and not too large. Otherwise you won't be able to see something.<br>
   ![](../img/doc_pnm_visualization_scale.png)
   - For showing the actual size of the pore bodies, choose e.g. `poreInscribedRadius` as the `Scale Array`. Again choose to `Scale Factor` appropriate (easiest way is to click on the respective icon as described above).<br>
   ![](../img/doc_pnm_visualization_scale2.png)
3. Within the section `Masking`, select under `Glyph Mode` to apply the sphere filter to `All Points`. <br>
![](../img/doc_pnm_visualization_masking.png)
1. Apply this filter with the properties defined before by clicking `Apply`. <br>
![apply](../img/doc_pnm_visualization_apply.png)

This should lead to something like the following:
<figure>
    <center>
        <img src="../img/doc_pnm_visualization_resultSpheres.png" width="60%"/>
        <figcaption> <b> Fig.1 </b> - Visualized pore-network with represented pore bodies as spheres. The size of the spheres is scaled by the pore inscribed radius.
        </figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>

### Representation as cubes/boxes
1. (see 1. from [above](#representation-as-spheres))
2. (see 2. from [above](#representation-as-spheres))
3. Within the `Properties` panel, go to the `Glyph Source` section and choose the `Glyph Type` as `Box`.
4. In the `Scale` section, you can modify how large the cubes should be displayed. 
   - For showing all pore bodies with the same size, choose for the `Scale Array` -> `No scale array`, then adapt the `Scale factor` as described [above](#representation-as-spheres).
   - For showing the actual size of the pore bodies, choose e.g. `poreInscribedRadius` as the `Scale Array`. Again choose to `Scale Factor` appropriate.
5. Continue for step 5 and 6 from [above](#representation-as-spheres)
<figure>
    <center>
        <img src="../img/doc_pnm_visualization_resultBox.png" width="60%"/>
        <figcaption> <b> Fig.2 </b> - Visualized pore-network with represented pore bodies as cubes (`Box` filter). The size of the spheres is scaled by the pore inscribed radius.
        </figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>

## Change representation of pore throats
### Representation as cylinders/tubes
For showing the pore throats as cylinders instead of lines, we use apply the tube filter in the following.
1. Select your input file (.pvd or .vtp) in the Pipeline Browser. <br>
![](../img/doc_pnm_visualization_pipelineBrowser.png)
1. Choose the `Tube` filter by going to the `Filters` -> `Alphabetical` -> `Tube`
2. In the `Properties` panel: increase the `Number of Sides` to e.g. 10 for a smoother reprentation of the tubes. <br>
![](../img/doc_pnm_visualization_tubeSides.png)
1. Leave everything else and click `Apply`.

Just showing the pore throats of the network will look e.g. like
<figure>
    <center>
        <img src="../img/doc_pnm_visualization_resultTubes.png" width="60%"/>
        <figcaption> <b> Fig.3 </b> - Visualized pore-network only showing the pore throats represented as tubes.
        </figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>

>Note: The size of the tubes can only be scaled by `Point Data` (e.g. pore inscribed radius), but not by cell data as e.g. throat inscribed radius. To do so, the cell data first has be to transformed to point data. This can be done with the filter `CellDatatoPointData`. Subsequently applying the `Tube` filter to the applyed `CellDatatoPointData` filter (select `CellDatatoPointData` in the `Pipeline Browser` before using the `Tube` filter). <br>
