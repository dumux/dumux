# Shallow water flow with bottom friction
In this example, the shallow water flow model is applied to simulate
a steady subcritical flow including bottom friction (bed shear stress).

__You will learn how to__

* solve a shallow water flow problem including bottom friction
* compute and output (VTK) an analytical reference solution

__Result__. The numerical and analytical solutions for the free surface will look like this:

## Problem set-up
### Model domain
The model domain is given by a rough channel with a slope of 0.001.
The domain is $`500 \, \mathrm{m}`$ long and $`5 \mathrm{m}`$ wide.
The bottom altitude is $`10\, \mathrm{m}`$ at the inflow and hence $`9.5\, \mathrm{m}`$ at the outflow.
Bottom friction is considered by applying
[Manning's law](#mannings-law) ($`n`$ = 0.025).

### Boundary conditions
At the lateral sides a no-flow boundary condition is applied. Also, no friction is
considered there and therefore a no slip boundary
condition is applied. These are the default boundary conditions for the shallow
water model. At the left border, a discharge boundary condition
is applied as inflow boundary condition with $`q = -1.0\, \mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-1}`$.
At the right border, a fixed water depth boundary condition
is applied for the outflow. Normal flow is assumed, therefore the water
depth at the right border is calculated using the equation
of [Gauckler, Manning and Strickler](#analytical-solution).

### Initial conditions
The initial water depth is set to $1\, \mathrm{m}$, which is slightly higher than the normal flow
water depth ($0.87\, \mathrm{m}$). Therefore, we expect a decreasing
water level during the simulation until the normal flow condition is reached in
the entire model domain. The initial velocity is set to zero.

## Model description
As mentioned above, this example uses the shallow water equations (SWEs) to solve the problem.
These are a depth-averaged simplification of the Navier-Stokes equations. To calculate the
bottom friction, Manning's law is used. An alternative is Nikuradse's law, which is also implemented
in DuMu<sup>x</sup>.

### Shallow water model
The shallow water equations are given as:

```math
\frac{\partial \mathbf{U}}{\partial t} +
\frac{\partial \mathbf{F}}{\partial x} +
\frac{\partial \mathbf{G}}{\partial y} - \mathbf{S_b} - \mathbf{S_f} = 0
```

where $`\mathbf{U}`$, $`\mathbf{F}`$ and $`\mathbf{G}`$ are defined as

```math
\mathbf{U} = \begin{bmatrix} h \\ uh \\ vh \end{bmatrix},
\mathbf{F} = \begin{bmatrix} hu \\ hu^2  + \frac{1}{2} gh^2 \\ huv \end{bmatrix},
\mathbf{G} = \begin{bmatrix} hv \\ huv \\ hv^2  + \frac{1}{2} gh^2 \end{bmatrix},
```

$`h`$ is the water depth, $`u`$ and $`v`$ are the velocities in x- and y-direction, respectively,
and $`g`$ is the gravitational acceleration.

The source terms for the bed slope $`\mathbf{S_b}`$ and friction
$`\mathbf{S_f}`$ are given as

```math
\mathbf{S_b} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -gh \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}
               \\ -gh \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\end{bmatrix},
\mathbf{S_f} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ghS_{fx} \\ghS_{fy}\end{bmatrix},
```

with the bed surface $`z`$. $`S_{fx}`$ and $`S_{fy}`$ are the bed shear stess
components in x- and y-direction, which are calculated by Manning's law.

### Mannings law
The empirical Manning model specifies the bed shear stress by the following equations:

```math
S_{fx} = \frac{n^2u}{R_{hy}^{4/3}} \sqrt(u^2 + v^2),

S_{fy} = \frac{n^2v}{R_{hy}^{4/3}} \sqrt(u^2 + v^2)
```

$`n`$ is Manning's friction value and $`R_{hy}`$ is the hydraulic radius,
which is assumed to be equal to the water depth $`h`$.

### Analytical solution
Since normal flow conditions are assumed, the analytic solution is calculated using the equation
of Gauckler, Manning and Strickler:

```math
v_m = n^{-1} R_{hy}^{2/3} I_s^{1/2},
```

where the mean velocity $`v_m`$ is given as

```math
v_m = \frac{q}{h},
```

$`I_s`$ is the bed slope and $`q`$ the unity inflow discharge.

Hence, the water depth $`h`$ can be calculated by

```math
h = \left(\frac{n q}{\sqrt{I_s}} \right)^{3/5}
```

### Discretization
For this example, a cell-centered finite volume method (cctpfa) is applied to solve the SWEs
in combination with a fully-implicit time discretization. For cases where no sharp fronts or
traveling waves occur it is possible to apply time steps larger than CFL number = 1 to reduce
the computation time. Even if a steady state solution is considered, an implicit time stepping method
is applied.
