    "description": "DuMux is short for DUNE for Multi-{Phase, Component, Scale, Physics, …} flow and transport in porous media; is a free and open-source simulator for flow and transport processes in porous media; is a research code written in C++; is based on the research software framework DUNE (Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment) and technically a DUNE discretization and user module. Its main intention is to provide a sustainable and consistent framework for the implementation and application of porous media model concepts and constitutive relations.",
