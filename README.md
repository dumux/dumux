# What is DuMux?

[DuMu<sup>x</sup>][0] is a simulation framework with a focus on
finite volume discretization methods, model coupling for multi-physics applications,
and flow and transport applications in porous media.

DuMu<sup>x</sup> is based on the [DUNE][1] framework from which it uses
the versatile grid interface, vector and matrix types, geometry and local basis functions, and linear solvers.
DuMu<sup>x</sup> then provides

* Finite volume discretizations (Tpfa, Mpfa, Staggered) and control-volume finite element discretization schemes
* A flexible system matrix assembler and approximation of the Jacobian matrix by numeric differentation
* A customizable Newton method implementation including line search and various stopping criteria
* Many preimplemented models (Darcy-scale porous media flow, Navier-Stokes, Geomechanics, Pore network models, Shallow water equations) and constitutive models
* A multi-domain framework for model coupling suited to couple subproblems with different discretizations/domains/physics/dimensions/... and create monolithic solvers

DuMu<sup>x</sup> has been applied to model complex and non-linear phenomena,
such as $\mathrm{CO}_2$ sequestration, soil remediation, reactive transport and precipitaion phenomena,
drug delivery in cancer therapy, flow in micro-fluidics, root-soil interaction,
flow in fractured porous media, atmosphere-soil flow interaction, evaporation and more.

for a more detailed description of the goals the development history
and motivations behind DuMu<sup>x</sup>.

# Automated Testing / Test suite

* Latest release (3.7): [![release build badge](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/badges/releases/3.7/pipeline.svg)](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/pipelines?page=1&scope=all&ref=releases/3.7)
* Master branch (development / unstable): [![master build badge](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/pipelines?page=1&scope=all&ref=master)


DuMu<sup>x</sup> features many tests (some unit tests and test problems) that
are continuously and automatically tested in the GitLab-CI framework (see badges).
The test suite is based on CTest and can also be built and run manually
```
make -j8 build_tests && ctest -j8
```
The tests are labelled (see `CMakeLists.txt` of each individual test for its labels).
You can build and run tests of a specific label (e.g. `2p` for two-phase flow porous medium model tests) like this
```
make -j8 build_2p_tests && ctest -j8 -L ^2p$
```

## Running individual tests

To find out how to build a test inspect the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the respective test folder.

The `dumux_add_test`
command specifies some important parameters: `NAME` sets the name of the test. There is either `SOURCES` or `TARGET`
specified. If `SOURCES` is specified `NAME`, corresponds to the build target, otherwise `TARGET` is the build target.

You can build the test by running `make REPLACE_BY_NAME_OF_BUILD_TARGET` (when using GNU Makefiles (default) this is possible
within the test folder in the build directory, for `ninja` it has to be executed in the top-most build folder level).

Some tests may depend on additional optional dependencies. You can find this by inspecting the argument `CMAKE_GUARD`,
e.g. `HAVE_UMFPACK` means UMFPack is required (via installing Suitesparse), or `( "dune-foamgrid_FOUND" AND "dune-alugrid_FOUND" )`
means that the test requires the additional Dune modules `dune-foamgrid` and `dune-alugrid`. For installing
external dependencies, have a look at the [Handbook](https://dumux.org/docs/handbook/master/dumux-handbook.pdf)
and the script [dumux/bin/installexternal.py](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/blob/master/bin/installexternal.py).

## Test coverage

[![coverage report](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux-coverage/badges/master/coverage.svg)](https://pages.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux-coverage/)

A weekly coverage report of the test suite is created by gcovr/gcov. The report
currently doesn't include non-instantiated code, so the real coverage is likely lower. However,
only a few lines of code are never instatiated in the comprehensive test suite.

# Releases and backwards compatibility policy

For a detailed description of the backwards compatibility policy,
please see [contribution guidelines](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

DuMu<sup>x</sup> releases are split into major (e.g. 2.0, 3.0) and minor (e.g. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) releases.
Major releases are not required to maintain backwards compatibility (see below),
but would provide a detailed guide on how to update dependent modules.
For each minor release, maintaining backwards compatibility is strongly encouraged and recommended.

Despite the goal of maintaining backwards compatibility across minor releases,
for more complicated changes, this is decided upon on a case to case basis, due to limited developer resources.
In the case that implementing full backwards compatibility for an update is not feasible, or would require unreasonable resources,
the degree of backwards compatibility be decided by a vote in one of the monthly core developer meetings.
