What is DuMuX?
===============

[DuMuX][0] is a simulation toolbox mainly aimed at flow and transport
processes in porous media. DuMuX is based on the [DUNE][1]
framework and aims to provide a multitude of numerical models as well
as flexible discretization methods for complex non-linear phenomena,
such as CO2 sequestration, soil remediation, drug delivery in cancer
therapy and more. See [our publication][2] for a more detailed
description of the goals and motivations behind DuMuX.


Installation
===============

Have a look at the [installation guide][3] or use the [DuMuX handbook]
[4], chapter 2.

Automated Testing
==================

DuMuX features many tests (some unit tests and test problems) that can
be run manually. We have experimental support for automated testing with buildbot.
