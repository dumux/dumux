What is DuMu<sup>x</sup>?
===============

[DuMu<sup>x</sup>][0] is a simulation toolbox mainly aimed at flow and transport
processes in porous media. DuMu<sup>x</sup> is based on the [DUNE][1]
framework and aims to provide a multitude of numerical models as well
as flexible discretization methods for complex non-linear phenomena,
such as CO2 sequestration, soil remediation, drug delivery in cancer
therapy and more. Have a look at our publications
(see below: [How to cite](#how-to-cite))
for a more detailed description of the goals and motivations behind DuMu<sup>x</sup>.

Automated Testing / Test suite
===============================
* Latest release (3.5): [![release build badge](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/badges/releases/3.5/pipeline.svg)](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/pipelines?page=1&scope=all&ref=releases/3.5)

DuMu<sup>x</sup> features many tests (some unit tests and test problems) that
are continuously and automatically tested in the GitLab-CI framework (see badges).
The test suite is based on CTest and can also be built and run manually
```
make -j8 build_tests && ctest -j8
```
The tests are labelled (see `CMakeLists.txt` of each individual test for its labels).
You can build and run tests of a specific label (e.g. `2p` for two-phase flow porous medium model tests) like this
```
make -j8 build_2p_tests && ctest -j8 -L ^2p$
```

__Running individual tests__

To find out how to build a test inspect the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the respective test folder. 

The `dumux_add_test`
command specifies some important parameters: `NAME` sets the name of the test. There is either `SOURCES` or `TARGET`
specified. If `SOURCES` is specified `NAME`, corresponds to the build target, otherwise `TARGET` is the build target.

You can build the test by running `make REPLACE_BY_NAME_OF_BUILD_TARGET` (when using GNU Makefiles (default) this is possible
within the test folder in the build directory, for `ninja` it has to be executed in the top-most build folder level).

Some tests may depend on additional optional dependencies. You can find this by inspecting the argument `CMAKE_GUARD`,
e.g. `HAVE_UMFPACK` means UMFPack is required (via installing Suitesparse), or `( "dune-foamgrid_FOUND" AND "dune-alugrid_FOUND" )`
means that the test requires the additional Dune modules `dune-foamgrid` and `dune-alugrid`. For installing
external dependencies, have a look at the [Handbook](https://dumux.org/docs/handbook/master/dumux-handbook.pdf)
and the script [dumux/bin/installexternal.py](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/blob/master/bin/installexternal.py).

__Test coverage__

[![coverage report](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux-coverage/badges/master/coverage.svg)](https://pages.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux-coverage/)

A weekly coverage report of the test suite is created by gcovr/gcov. The report
currently doesn't include non-instantiated code, so the real coverage is likely lower. However,
only a few lines of code are never instantiated in the comprehensive test suite.


Contributing

Please review the [contribution guidelines](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before opening issues and merge requests. For bug reports contact us
over the mailing list, or file an [issue](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/issues). For bug fixes,
feature implementations open a [merge request](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/merge_requests)
or send us formatted patches.

Releases and backwards compatibility policy
============================================

For a detailed description of the backwards compatibility policy,
please see [contribution guidelines](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

DuMu<sup>x</sup> releases are split into major(e.g. 2.0, 3.0) and minor (e.g. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) releases.
Major releases are not required to maintain backwards compatibility (see below),
but would provide a detailed guide on how to update dependent modules.
For each minor release, maintaining backwards compatibility is strongly encouraged and recommended.

Despite the goal of maintaining backwards compatibility across minor releases,
for more complicated changes, this is decided upon on a case to case basis, due to limited developer resources.
In the case that implementing full backwards compatibility for an update is not feasible, or would require unreasonable resources,
the degree of backwards compatibility be decided by a vote in one of the monthly core developer meetings.
